    <p class="explanation"><strong>Name: </strong>Gift T. Atubo<br><strong>Job Title: </strong>Agro Tech Manager<br><br>
     Oversees all aspects of running farms and other facilities that produce crops. He plans, supervise, and sometimes 
     participate in planting, fertilizing, and harvesting crops.
     Well, obviously farmers and stockmen will be the most interested, but so will people who sell to them such as
     implement dealers, ag supply stores, fuel sales, etc. Also, people in the crop insurance field have a huge stake 
     in the weather, as do government agencies who work with farmers and ranchers. But, outside of the farmers themselves,
     probably the biggest industry in terms of money will be bankers and commodity brokers. Fortunes can turn on a single
      hail storm or extended drought, so they follow the reports avidly.
